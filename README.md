## Motivation - what problem does it intend to solve?

> 1. To make users feel more connected by having smaller communities
- Nowadays almost all the social media(instagram, FB, snapchat etc) are too big, too broad, too much of distruction. This application specifically focuses on motorcyclists, to make community size smaller to let people feel more connected(too big community is difficult to manage, feel connected and engage in .)
> 2. To reduce any commercial distruction as much as possible, to serve users
-   I want the purpose of a social media to be connecting people and making them feel secure, belong to a community, instead of tricking users brains and behaviors to make them buy stuff).  

> Why did I undertake it?
- Because personally I have not been a fun of huge social media out there(instagram, facebook, snapchat etc) as their way of maximizing their company seems to be making users hooked with their services by attention-engineering, and I think it has been really challenging problem for any generations especially younger ones. Therefore I wanted to make a social media that merely serves them, intead of using their attention.
